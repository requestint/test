  1. A package that'll help with the bot being able to find unusual behavior such as
  the roblox client (player) attempting to add a screen gui, which is typically their cheat panel,

  2. Visual Console On the roblox end that'll provide live signals that relate to any actions done on the roblox side about the bot
  and more!
